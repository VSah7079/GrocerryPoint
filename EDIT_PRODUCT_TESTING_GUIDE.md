## Testing Steps

### Prerequisites
1. **Backend Server**: Ensure the backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`
2. **Frontend Server**: Start the frontend development server
3. **Admin Access**: Login as admin user to access the product management page

### Step 1: Access Product Management
```
1. Navigate to admin dashboard
2. Go to Product Management page
3. Verify products are loading correctly
```

### Step 2: Test Backend Connection
```
1. Click "Test Connection" button
2. Check browser console for connection status
3. Verify success/error messages display properly
```

### Step 3: Test Edit Product Flow

#### A. Open Edit Modal
```
1. Find any product in the products table
2. Click the edit button (pencil icon)
3. Verify:
   - Modal opens with "Edit Product" title
   - Product name and ID shown in header
   - All form fields are populated with existing data
   - Category dropdown shows correct selection
   - Product row is highlighted in blue with "Editing" badge
```

#### B. Modify Product Data
```
1. Change product name
2. Update price (use valid number format)
3. Modify stock quantity
4. Change description
5. Update category selection
6. Toggle featured status if needed
```

#### C. Save Changes
```
1. Click "Save Product" button
2. Monitor browser console for API calls
3. Verify success message appears
4. Check that modal closes
5. Confirm product list refreshes
6. Validate changes are reflected in the product table
```

### Step 4: Error Scenario Testing

#### A. Network Errors
```
1. Stop the backend server
2. Try to edit a product
3. Verify appropriate error message about backend connection
4. Restart backend and test again
```

#### B. Validation Errors
```
1. Try saving with invalid price (e.g., negative number or text)
2. Leave required fields empty
3. Verify error messages are clear and helpful
```

#### C. Authentication Errors
```
1. Clear authentication tokens from localStorage
2. Try to edit a product
3. Verify proper authentication error handling
```

### Step 5: Console Debugging
Open browser developer tools and check the console for:

```javascript
// Expected log messages during edit flow:
✅ "Editing product: {productData}"
✅ "Loading product for edit: {productData}"
✅ "Saving product: {editingProduct, productData}"
✅ "Updating existing product: {productId}"
✅ "API: Updating product with ID: {id} Data: {productData}"
✅ "Update response: {response}"
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Products Not Loading
**Symptoms**: Empty product table, loading indefinitely
**Solutions**:
- Check if backend is running on port 5000
- Verify database connection in backend
- Check browser network tab for API call failures
- Use "Test Connection" button to verify backend connectivity

### Issue 2: Edit Modal Not Populating Data
**Symptoms**: Modal opens but fields are empty
**Solutions**:
- Check console for "Loading product for edit" log
- Verify product object has all required properties
- Check if product ID is valid

### Issue 3: Save Operation Fails
**Symptoms**: Error messages during save operation
**Solutions**:
- Check authentication token in localStorage
- Verify admin privileges
- Check product data format in console logs
- Ensure backend API endpoints are responding

### Issue 4: Categories Not Loading
**Symptoms**: Category dropdown shows "Loading..." or is empty
**Solutions**:
- Check categories API endpoint: `/api/categories`
- Verify category data structure
- Check fallback category handling

## API Endpoints Used

```
GET    /api/products              - Fetch all products
GET    /api/products/admin/stats  - Get admin statistics
PUT    /api/products/:id          - Update specific product
POST   /api/products              - Create new product
DELETE /api/products/:id          - Delete product
GET    /api/categories            - Fetch categories
```

## Expected Data Formats

### Product Object
```javascript
{
  _id: "string",
  name: "string",
  category: "string" | { _id: "string", name: "string" },
  price: number,
  stock: number,
  image: "string",
  description: "string",
  unit: "string",
  isFeatured: boolean,
  discount: number,
  tags: array
}
```

### Update API Request
```javascript
PUT /api/products/:id
{
  name: "Updated Product Name",
  category: "categoryId",
  price: 29.99,
  stock: 100,
  description: "Updated description",
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Success Criteria

The edit product functionality is working correctly if:

1. ✅ Product edit modal opens with pre-populated data
2. ✅ Visual indicators show which product is being edited
3. ✅ Form validation works properly
4. ✅ API calls are made correctly to backend
5. ✅ Success/error messages are displayed appropriately
6. ✅ Product list refreshes after successful update
7. ✅ Console logging provides clear debugging information
8. ✅ Error scenarios are handled gracefully

## Additional Notes

- All changes are logged to browser console for debugging
- Messages auto-clear after a few seconds but can be manually dismissed
- Backend connectivity is tested before making API calls
- Form data is validated before submission
- Authentication errors are handled with clear messaging

For any issues not covered in this guide, check the browser console for detailed error logs and API response information.
